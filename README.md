### What I learned

- This project utilized a custom "front-end database" where the data can be stored and allows
  the user to save the work but its not persistant and will reset on a refresh. This was because the
  project was suppose to be front-end only and I was trying to avoid making a true backend but as I progressed
  I kept adding more and more features to it. In hindsight, making the project full-stack and using an actual backend framework
  like Express/MongoDB would have been much easier and sensible than what I ended up doing.
